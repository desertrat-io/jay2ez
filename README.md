I love Java, and I'm also tired of simple things being too verbose. Sure, verbosity is sometimes a good thing
when it comes to...well certain things.

But what about simple stuff like just dumping text out to a file? How about something like file_puts_contents from PHP?

No, what do you have to do? Bunch of crap. Important crap that's showing off some great uses of OOP, but still sometimes
ya just don't care.

Soooooo yeah. Enjoy. Another pet project to goof off with and maybe learn a few things, another of endless
libraries and tools to promise to make it all less painful.
